Tables:

 () One table of languages, containing the ISO-639 code and the name of that
    language in that language. 

 () One table of users, containing a username and email address

 () One table of users X languages (usernames and ISO-639 codes)



Creation commands (run as admin): 

create table users (id varchar(255) primary key not null, email varchar(255) not null);
create table languages (id varchar(255) primary key not null, name varchar(255) not null);
create table whospeakswhat (user varchar(255) not null references users(id), language varchar(255) not null references languages(id), level varchar(10) not null, constraint pk_whospeakswhat primary key (user, language));

Database (and associated user) is named "nyelv". Password is stored under
nearlyfreespeech-nyelv.db-nyelv in encrypted file. 

"Level" in whospeakswhat table currently holds A, B, C or N. In the future, we
may add additional categories, but they probably won't be more than a couple of
characters long. 



Connecting from Python:
