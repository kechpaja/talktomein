Tables:

 () One table of languages, containing the ISO-639 code and the name of that
    language in that language. 

 () One table of users, containing a username and email address, as well as
    settings information indicating whether that user wants to get the
    newsletter or marketing emails. 

 () One table of users X languages (usernames and ISO-639 codes)



Creation commands (run as admin): 

create table users (id varchar(255) primary key not null, email varchar(255) not null, permission boolean not null default 0, newsletter boolean not null default 0, marketing boolean not null default 0);
create table languages (id varchar(255) primary key not null, name varchar(255) not null);
create table whospeakswhat (user varchar(255) not null references users(id), language varchar(255) not null references languages(id), level varchar(10) not null, constraint pk_whospeakswhat primary key (user, language));

"Level" in whospeakswhat table currently holds A, B, or C. In the future, we
may add additional categories, but they probably won't be more than a couple of
characters long.
