Tables:

 () One table of languages, containing the ISO-639 code and the name of that
    language in that language. 

 () One table of users, containing a username and email address

 () One table of users X languages (usernames and ISO-639 codes)



Creation commands (run as admin): 

create table users (id varchar(255) primary key not null, email varchar(255) not null, permission boolean not null default 0, newsletter boolean not null default 0, marketing boolean not null default 0);
create table languages (id varchar(255) primary key not null, name varchar(255) not null);
create table whospeakswhat (user varchar(255) not null references users(id), language varchar(255) not null references languages(id), level varchar(10) not null, constraint pk_whospeakswhat primary key (user, language));

"Level" in whospeakswhat table currently holds A, B, or C. In the future, we
may add additional categories, but they probably won't be more than a couple of
characters long. 


session_tokens and login_tokens:

id (varchar), user (varchar), timestamp (datetime)


There will probably be a scheduled task to delete old tokens:

create event delete_old_session_tokens on schedule every 1 day on completion preserve do delete from session_tokens where timestamp < now() - interval 1 month;

create event delete_old_login_tokens on schedule every 30 minute on completion preserve do delete from session_tokens where timestamp < now() - interval 30 minute;
