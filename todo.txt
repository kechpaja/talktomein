Add talktomein.com domain to Zoho mail account, if possible

Contact page?


Add section to login emails explaining that user can delete their account if
they need to. Unsubscribe link would be a good idea.

Create endpoint for starting the login flow.


Create dedicated methods for the different login/auth links

Auto-save?


Perhaps use JS filter to allow for an autocompleting list of languages?

Yes. I'll need a function for sorting each list of languages, and one for
inserting the new one, as well as moving it around as the user tabs through
levels. May also want to put change level buttons on each language bar.
