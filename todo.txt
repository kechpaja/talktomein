Add borders to add and remove buttons

Add hover and active colors to add and remove buttons

Dragging and dropping? Or something else?


Add talktomein.com domain to Zoho mail account, if possible

when they delete their account. 



Actually do something with permission check box data

Point out to user that they can delete their data at any time.
