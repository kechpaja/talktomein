Add talktomein.com domain to Zoho mail account, if possible

Make it look like emails from my site come from there


Contact page?


Add section to login emails explaining that user can delete their account if
they need to. Unsubscribe link would be a good idea. 



For security, consider adding user agent information to signed session token.


Create endpoint for starting the login flow.


Create dedicated methods for the different login/auth links


Perhaps use JS filter to allow for an autocompleting list of languages?


Localization


Revisit ams, ryn, kzg in database --- the names I saved them under should
probably be updated to reflect their native names.


Go through entire list of languages from time to time, and pick a few that
could stand to be updated. Do some actual research, and determine what their
native names are.



Figure out how to get SQL to reject invalid levels and language names?

Switch from itsdangerous back to regular database of tokens for auth (possibly
using Redis?)
