Allow user to add star for each language considered native?

Allow user to set order of languages (how to do that in DB? Can it be auto?).

Add borders to add and remove buttons

Add hover and active colors to add and remove buttons



Perhaps have an add button after each existing language? 

Perhaps delete language when it's added elsewhere?

Dragging and dropping? Or something else?


Add talktomein.com domain to Zoho mail account, if possible

Make it look like emails from my site come from there



Add some sort of terms and conditions? Or at least explain that by adding their
data, they consent to it being stored in my DB and shared publicly, and that
they can delete their account at any time.

Say that emails will only be used to performs logins, as well as possibly
sending out technical emails if necessary. Perhaps allow for joining newsletter
and non-site-related mailing lists?

Email will never be shared with third parties. 


Contact page?


Start splitting up flows across a number of endpoints, instead of doing
everything at / the way it currently works. 


Add section to login emails explaining that user can delete their account if
they need to, and that if they get a bunch of login links that they didn't
request it might mean that someone is trying to get into their account.



For security, consider adding user agent information to signed session token.



We should have a separate endpoint and token salt for adding a user, and
possibly also for deleting one.
