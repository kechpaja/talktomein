Consider getting rid of native language category, and allow user to add star
for each language considered native, regardless of level

Consider updating styling

Consider adding level markers (possibly A, B, and C) on the left-hand side of
the list (before stars).

Allow user to set order of languages (how to do that in DB? Can it be auto?).

Set up update submission as form, so that we don't need to use as much JS.
